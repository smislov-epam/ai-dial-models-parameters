# Models to try:
# - gpt-4o
# - claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219

# Pay attention to the number of choices in the response!
# If you have worked with ChatGPT, you have probably seen responses where ChatGPT offers you a choice between two
# responses to select which one you prefer. This is done with the `n` parameter.
